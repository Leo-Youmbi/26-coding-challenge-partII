[27](./27.py): Create a fxn that will receive an array of numbers as argument and will return a new array with distinct elements.  
[28](./28.py): Calculate the sum of the first 100 prime numbers and return them in array.  
[29](./29.py): Print the distance between the first 100 prime numbers.  
[30](./30.py): Create a fxn that will add two positive numbers of indefinite size. The numbers are received as strings and the result should be also provided as a string.  
[31](./31.py): Create a fxn that will return the number of words in a text.  
[32](./32.py): Create a fxn that will capitalize the first letter of each word in a text.  
[33](./33.py): Calculate the sum of numbers received in a comma delimited string.  
[34](./34.py): Create a fxn that returns an array with words inside a text.  
[35](./35.py): Create a fxn to convert a CSV text to a "bi-dimensional" array.  
[36](./36.py): Create a fxn that converts a string to an array of characters.  
[37](./37.py): Create a fxn that will convert a string in an array containing the ASCII codes of each character.

[39](./39.py): Implement the Caesar cypher.  
[40](./40.py): Implement the bubble sort algorithm for an array of numbers.  
[41](./41.py): Create a fxn that calculates the distance between two points defined by x, y coordinates.

[46](./46.py): Find the max number in a jagged array or array of numbers.  
[47](./47.py): Deep copy a jagged array with numbers or other arrays in new array.  
[48](./48.py): Create a fxn to return the longest word in a string.  
[49](./49.py): Shuffle an array of strings.    
[50](./50.py): Implement the bubble sort algorithm for an array of numbers.    
[51](./51.py): Implement the bubble sort algorithm for an array of numbers.
