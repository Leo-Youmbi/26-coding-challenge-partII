## Tasks 
[27](./27.py): Create a fxn that will receive an array of numbers as argument and will return a new array with distinct elements.  
[28](./28.py): Calculate the sum of the first 100 prime numbers and return them in array.  
[29](./29.py): Print the distance between the first 100 prime numbers.  
[30](./30.py): Create a fxn that will add two positive numbers of indefinite size. The numbers are received as strings and the result should be also provided as a string.  
[31](./31.py): Create a fxn that will return the number of words in a text.  
[32](./32.py): Create a fxn that will capitalize the first letter of each word in a text.  
[33](./33.py): Calculate the sum of numbers received in a comma delimited string.  
[34](./34.py): Create a fxn that returns an array with words inside a text.  
[35](./35.py): Create a fxn to convert a CSV text to a "`bi-dimensional`" array.  
[36](./36.py): Create a fxn that converts a string to an array of characters.  
[37](./37.py): Create a fxn that will convert a string in an array containing the ASCII codes of each character.  
[38](./38.py): Create a fxn that will convert an array containing ASCII codes in a string.  
[39](./39.py): Implement the `Caesar cypher`.  
[40](./40.py): Implement the bubble sort algorithm for an array of numbers.  
[41](./41.py): Create a fxn that calculates the distance between two points defined by `x`, `y` coordinates.  
[42](./42.py): Create a fxn that will return a Boolean value indicating if two circles defined by center coordinates and radius are intersection.  
[43](./43.py): Create a fxn that will receive a bi-dimensional array as argument and a number and will extract as a unidimensional array the column specified by the number.  
[44](./44.py): Create a fxn that will convert a string containing a binary number into a number.  
[45](./45.py): Create a fxn to calculate the sum of all the numbers in a jagged array (contains numbers or other arrays of numbers on an unlimited number of levels).  
[46](./46.py): Find the max number in a jagged array or array of numbers.  
[47](./47.py): Deep copy a jagged array with numbers or other arrays in new array.  
[48](./48.py): Create a fxn to return the longest word in a string.  
[49](./49.py): Shuffle an array of strings.    
[50](./50.py): Create a fxn that will receive `n` as an argument and return an array of `n` random numbers from 1 to `n`. The numbers should be unique inside the array.    
[51](./51.py): Find the frequency of letters inside a string. Return the result as an array of arrays. Each subarray has 2 elements: letter and number of occurrences.    
[52](./52.py): Calculate `Fibonacci(500)` with high precision (all digits).    
[53](./53.py): Calculate `70!` with high precision (all digits).
